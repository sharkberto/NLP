Findtool

Using a multilingual glossary, a segmented source file and a notes file, the findtool can produce a list of source-target terminology matches using words from the source file

e.g.

[cartridge = cartucho]

The output appears on a line in the notes column that corresponds to the location in which it was found in the source file.

if you align the note with the source column, in a spreadsheet, if you desire, it would look like this:

The cartridge is heavy.     [cartridge = cartucho]

As of v5, the findtool is case sensitive, thus a workaround is going to be created, such as normalizing all text before running the comparison.
